Welcome to my first personal project: Aicrag (backend)

The purpose of this project is to save monthly invoices from a transcription project. It is possible to save the amount of money you earn per each task and keep your records saved. The project can also have Quality Assurance, besides the Transcriptionist, so it is also possibile to save the records for QAs.
This project contains: signup, signin, account confirmation, password recovery and much more. This is a refactor from my previous version, which did not have Clean Architecture.

This backend was built with Node/Typescript with TDD, following Clean Architecture and principles as SOLID, DRY, YAGNI and KISS.

As this is my first personal project ever, you may find some stuffs that you disagree, but hey, I am learning! Feel free to contact me to appoint mistakes you found or any feedbacks! :)
